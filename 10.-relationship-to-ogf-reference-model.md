# 10. Relationship to OGF Reference Model

In this section, we describe the integration of the GLUE information model with the OGF Reference Model \[RM\]. The reference model defines the concept of Grid Component. In GLUE, a root concept called Entity is defined. Such a root concept MAY be defined as a specialization of the Grid Component concept, that means that all properties are inherited by the GLUE classes. In Figure 5, we represent this relationship by a UML class diagram.
